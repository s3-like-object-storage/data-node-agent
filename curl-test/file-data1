Since RandomAccessFile treats the file as a byte array, write operation can override the data as well as it
can append to a file. It all depends on the file pointer position. If the pointer is moved beyond the file length and
then write operation is called, then there will be junk data written in the file. So you should take care of this while
using write operation.
